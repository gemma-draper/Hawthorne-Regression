# Regression Project

## Introduction
This project is a continuation of Project Hawthorne, for which I wrote a Python web-scraper to collect drink recipes from user submitted recipe sites. The ultimate aim of Project Hawthorne is to create a recipe-generator bot which will invent, and then publish cocktail recipes to user-submitted websites.

For this regression project I applied supervised learning to solve a regression problem based on my own data. Several regression models were evaluated. The full evaluation process, including regularisation and hyperparameter tuning, is documented in the Jupyter notebooks in this repo. Results are displayed below.

## Project Brief & Deliverables

The project brief was to:
* Identify an industry relevant prediction problem.
* Develop a solution to this problem.
* Present the results.

Deliverables were:
* A GitHub repo containing all code.
* A presentation in two parts:
    1. **Non-technical presentation** highlighting the problem and the solution at a high level. This part explained the results that were attained and how they will drive business value.
    2. **Technical presentation** giving details of the techniques applied during data processing and modelling.
